          <li>
            <strong>Quote tool:</strong> scope answers you submit on /get-a-quote (processed to generate a

            <strong>Analytics:</strong> Google Analytics (GA4) and Vercel Analytics may collect usage data

            <strong>Comments:</strong> Disqus may set cookies and process data if you use comments on

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Why we use it</h2>
        <p>
          To respond to enquiries, improve the site, understand which content is useful, and operate
          comments. We do not sell your personal information.
        </p>

        <h2>Retention</h2>
        <p>
          Enquiry and quote data is kept only as long as needed for the conversation or project, unless
          law requires longer retention.
        </p>

        <h2>Your rights (South Africa)</h2>
        <p>
          Under POPIA you may request access, correction, or deletion of personal information we hold
          about you. Email{' '}
          <a href={`mailto:${AUTHOR_EMAIL}`}>{AUTHOR_EMAIL}</a> with the subject line &quot;POPIA
          request&quot;.
        </p>

        <h2>Third parties</h2>
        <p>
          Hosting and analytics may process data outside South Africa under their own terms (Vercel,
          Google). Disqus is governed by its privacy policy when you comment.
        </p>

        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>We will update this page when practices change. Material changes will be noted here.</p>
